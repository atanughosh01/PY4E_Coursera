I am a student of B.E (Graduation) in Computer Science & Engineering at Jadavpur University, Kolkata.
I do not have any source of income to pay for this course.
I belong to a lower-middle-class Indian family and since my parents are struggling to meet ends,and
I am still a student, I cannot afford to pay for this course.
Furthermore, I also do wish to enroll in the course "Machine Learning" by Andrew Ng sir in near
future through the financial aid program provided by Coursera.
I am sure that I'll find it helpful for my career as a Data Scientist.
Receiving this Financial Aid will open a new horizon of the world of Coursera courses for me.
That, in turn, will help me achieve my future goals and build a successful career.
I also plan to complete all the assignments on or before time to digest and apply the knowledge,
I'll learn from those respected professors.
The Financial Aid will only push me further towards my goals and my dreams of one day
having a successful career as a Data Scientist.
