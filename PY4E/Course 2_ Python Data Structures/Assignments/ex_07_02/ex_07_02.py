""" 7.2 Write a program that prompts for a file name, then opens that file and
reads through the file, looking for lines of the form: X-DSPAM-Confidence: 0.8475
Count these lines and extract the floating point values from each of the lines and
compute the average of those values and produce an output as shown below. Do not
